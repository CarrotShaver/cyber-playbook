    "# Basic Security\n",
    "\n",
    "- Disable Guest Accounts\n",
    "- Secure Patches and Automatic Updates\n",

    "# Users and Groups\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Users** are naive children, who cannot be trusted, which is why they are controlled in **Groups**\n",
    "- Users can belong to multiple groups, which at a basic level reject or accept user actions\n",
    "- All processes on a system are attached to a user, or can be accessed by certain users/groups\n",
    "- Principle of Least Privelage (Good security policy)\n",
    "    - Basically the principle of giving users as little privelages as possible\n",
    "    - User should have a good reason to be given access to something\n",
    "\n",
    "### Users\n",
    "\n",
    "- Authorizing and Autheticating\n",
    "    - Different meanings.  Authentication is verifying a user is legitimate (ex. username+password).\n",
    "        - Usually there should be several layers of authentication due to vulnerabilities\n",
    "    - Authorization involves permissions for a user, the programs and utilities available to a user\n",

    "\n",
    "**Basic Principles**\n",
    "- Principle of least privilege\n",
    "    - The less access a user has the better\n",
    "    - Give access to one thing at a time, temporarily, and only with good reason\n",
    "- Defense in depth\n",
    "    - Have multiple levels of defenses, multiple firewalls, permissions, multi-factor authentication, etc.\n",

    "    - Password manager (ex. lastpass), reasoning being using a company who's job is to secure your password vs. yourself\n",
    "    - Resetting passwords, recycling passwords.  Minimum length of time and maximum length of time.\n",
    "        - Subjective as far as time goes, but generally don't want users to have to reset password constantly/never\n",
    "        - Passwords should require a cooldwon to be recycled, or should never be recyclable\n",
    "- Recommended strong password settings\n",
    "    - Use a passphrase with 12+ characters\n",
    "    - Password requires a rotation every week\n",
    "    - Passwords cannot be reused\n",
    "- Password Managers\n",
    "    - Doesn't require users to remember all their passwords (can use a different, difficult password for each login)\n",
    "    - Program is managed by a company who's job is to secure these passwords\n",
    "    - Install LastPass\n",
    "        - Can use a long a difficult password since it is the only password you need to remember\n",
