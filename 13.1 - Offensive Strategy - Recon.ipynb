    "### Nmap\n",
    "1. Check hosts with ping scan\n",
    "    - `nmap -sn 192.168.254.0/24`\n",
    "    - The -sn flag will skip port scanning \n",
    "    - Can use `-sT` flag to do a SYN scan which is less likely to be seen by IDS\n",
    "2. After finding the correct target check open ports:\n",
    "    - A default nmap scan with no flags will do a -sS (stealth scan)\n",
    "    - `nmap 192.168.254.128`\n",
    "3. Check the versions of services running (-sV) and guess OS based on that (-O)\n",
    "    - `nmap -sV -O 192.168.254.128`\n",
    "    - Take note of information given here, may be useful to exploit\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Evading Detection - IDS, IPS, WAF\n",
    "- Important to take measures to prevent getting blocked by checking for an IDS or IPS before doing anything too loudly\n",
    "\n",
    "**Nmap**\n",
    "- Using scripts to test for the presence of a WAF\n",
    "    - This works by sending specific malicious requests that will have expected responses based on known patterns of the type of WAF being used\n",
    "1. `nmap -p 80,443 --script=http-waf-detect 192.168.254.128`\n",
    "    - This command tests ports 80 and 443 for a waf using a script\n",
    "    - If an IDS/IPS/WAF is detected you will see the port and alert\n",
    "2. `nmap -p 80,443 --script=http-waf-fingerprint www.example.com`\n",
    "    - This command test ports 80 and 443 for the device using a script\n",
    "    - This script will more precisely try to determine the type of device (IDS/IPS/WAF) as well as the device name\n",
    "        \n",
    "### Checking Source Code with OWASP Mantra\n",
    "- You can look at a web application's html code by right-clicking and selecting **View Page Source** or by pressing **f12** and switching to source\n",
    "    - Some examples of things to look for:\n",
    "        1. Libraries\n",
    "        2. External files being called\n",
    "        3. Subdomains being used\n",
    "        4. Input fields and the type/size of data expected\n",
    "- When checking with the **firebug** tool:\n",
    "    1. Console: This tab will show errors, warnings, and messages generated when loading a page\n",
    "    2. HTML: The page defaulted to show HTML from **View Page Source**\n",
    "    3. CSS: View and modify the CSS Stylings used to format the page\n",
    "    4. Script: See full HTML source, set breakpoints to interrupt the HTML as it loads and check variable values when running scripts\n",
    "    5. DOM: Document Object Model, shows objects, values, and hierarchy\n",
    "    6. Net: Displays server requests and responses, types, size, response time, and timeline order\n",
    "    7. Cookies: Displays cookies set by the server, values, and parameters\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Editing Cookies with OWASP Mantra\n",
    "- Open Cookie Manager: Click on wasp icon | Tools | Application Auditing | Cookies Manager+ | Find cookie and click \"edit\"\n",
    "- You can try to stop session hijackings or code injection by making sure a cookie is \"Http Only\" when editing\n",
    "\n",
    "### Robots.txt\n",
    "- The robots exclusion standard aka **robots.txt** is a standard used by websites to communicate with web crawlers, informing them about areas that should not be processed or scanned\n",
    "- Try accessing the directories found in robots.txt for information hidden to the public\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finding Files, Folders, and Directories\n",
    "- dirbuster\n",
    "    - Combination webcrawler/bruteforce, will check directory and subdirectories for hidden files and folders using a dictionary\n",
    "    - Open the gui with `dirbuster`\n",
    "- OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy)\n",
    "    1. Open the gui with `owasp-zap`\n",
    "    2. Configure proxy settings on browser to be manual `127.0.0.1 port 8080`\n",
    "        - Found in **Preferences | Advanced | Network | Connection | Settings** for firefox\n",
    "    3. Find list of owasp tools in **Tools | Options**\n",
    "        - Attack a URL, or view the directories on the left pane and right click to select a tool to use for the attack\n",
    "\n",
    "### Password Profiling with CeWL\n",
    "- Default dictionaries pre-installed in kali can be found in `/usr/share/wordlists/`\n",
    "- The cewl tool can be used to get words from an application which will save the results to a txt file (which can later be used as a dictionary)\n",
    "- `cewl -w cewl_WebsiteName.txt -c -m 5 http://192.168.254.128/WebsiteName/`\n",
    "    - This command opens cewl, writes (-w) to a file named cewl_WebsiteName.txt, counts (-c) the words it finds, with a minimum (-m) length of 5, from http://192.168.254.128/WebsiteName/\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Using John the Ripper for dictionary generation\n",
    "- Can be used to modify dictionary words during a brute force attack\n",
    "    - Can use the dictionary created with CeWL\n",
    "    - `john --stdout --wordlist=cewl_WebsiteName.txt --rules > WebsiteNameDictionary.txt`\n",
    "        - This command will modify words in the list by switching cases, adding suffixes/prefixes, and replacing letters with numbers and symbols\n",
    "        - Saves the output to WebsiteNameDictionary.txt\n",
    "        \n",

    "    - `wget -r -P bodgeit_pages/ http://192.168.254.128/bodgeit/`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Useful flags to consider with wget**\n",
    "- `-l` : Limit flag, limits the depth that a wget will follow when recursively traversing a website\n",
    "    - e.g. `-l 5` will go at most 5 directories deep in a website\n",
    "- `-k` : Modifies links to point to local files, making it possible to browse the site through a browser locally\n",
    "- `-p` : Enables wget to download images by page, even if on other sites\n",
    "- `-w` : Wait flag, makes wget wait x number of seconds between downloads, useful in evading detection in servers that look for automated browsers\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using WebScarab to spider a website\n",
