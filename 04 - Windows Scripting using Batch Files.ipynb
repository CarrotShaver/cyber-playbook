    "### Useful tips:\n",
    "    - PAUSE line command can be used to allow a user to view a process that is running or some query information\n",
    "        (ex. ipconfig \\n PAUSE ) would allow user to see the ipconfig information in a terminal window\n",
    "    - Can append queries to files with >> command (ex. ipconfig /all >> text.txt)\n",
    "    - SET: Find user specific variables using the SET command\n",
    "        - Set command will list variables like the user path or user profile (ex. dir %userprofile%\\Documents\\)\n",
    "        - This will allow a script to be non-specific, and can be run with global variables on any windows system\n",
