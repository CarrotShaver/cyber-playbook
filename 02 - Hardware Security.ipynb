    "# Securing Hardware on Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Some considerations for or steps to use when setting up basic PC hardware security\n",
    "1. BIOS Boot Password\n",
    "    - Set up a password through the BIOS which requires login on every bootup\n",
    "    - This will prevent anyone from getting to the OS software by having to login at BIOS step\n",
    "    - If needing reset due to forgotten password:\n",
    "        - Will require a second computer with internet access\n",
    "            - After three failed logins, the option to send password to a secondary computer on the network will be available\n",
    "        - If no secondary computer present: Remove MB battery for ~15 minutes (will cause battery to lose all power)\n",
    "            - Reinsert battery and all MB settings will be reset including the password\n",
    "2. If using a data center with server cabinets\n",
    "    - Having physical access to servers/computers would allow someone to take advantage of the above vulnerability\n",
    "    - Make sure to lock cabinets using a lock requiring a key (preferably physical key)\n",
    "3. Lock down boot order BIOS as well to stop users from changing the BIOS settings\n",
    "4. Drive encryption \n",
    "5. TLM or Trusted Platform Module (TPM)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Demilitarized Zone (DMZ)\n",
    "- A network that isn't public or local \"halfway between the two\"\n",
    "- Where you find HTTP, DNS service, email and other internet-type corporate servers\n",
    "- People outside your network primarily access your web servers, FTP servers etc. and because that's what hackers usually target, it's a good idea to place them behind the DMZ\n",
    "- Security zone that allows public traffic but the traffic is isolated from a company's network\n",
    "\n",
    "### Firewalls\n",
    "- Combination of hardware and software\n",
    "- The hardware is usually a router but it could also be a computer or dedicated piece of hardware called a black box that has 2 NIC's in it\n",
    "    - One NIC for private and the other for public\n",
    "- Firewall setup will determine permit, deny, encrypt, decrypt and proxy rules for traffic\n",
    "- Network based firewalls will protect packets entering a network, usually through hardware\n",
    "- Host based firewalls protect a single host, usually through software\n",
    "**Dynamic Packet Filtering**\n",
    "- Can be activated on a firewall to filter packets and check for suspicious packet activity within a network\n",
    "    - Things like expected packet orders, type of packet, etc. can be checked for\n",
    "**Content Filtering**\n",
    "- Blocking based on the content of the data rather than the source of the data\n",
    "- Commonly used in mail and web traffic to stop things like urls, .exe, phrases, language\n",
    "**Signature Identificiation**\n",
    "- Many viruses and malware may have signatures of data patterns within them that can be identified and removed by the firewall\n",
    "**IP Proxy**\n",
    "- Allows a user to hide their IP by exchanging its IP for the address of any requesting station\n",
    "**Web Proxy**\n",
    "- Handle HTTP requests on behalf of the sending workstation, client's web browser asks a web server on the internet for a web page using an http request\n",
    "**Access Control List (ACL)**\n",
    "- First line of defense on a network, controls which machines are allowed to use routers on a network and on what direction\n",
    "- Threats mitigated by ACL\n",
    "    - IP address spoofing, inbound & outbound\n",
    "    - DOS TCP SYN Attacks\n",
    "    - DoS Smurf Attacks\n",
    "    - Filtering ICMP messages inbound & outbound\n",
    "    - Filtering traceroute\n",
    "- Setting up an ACL\n",
    "```\n",
    "Access List made up mostly of if-then type statements\n",
    " if _condition_ is met\n",
    "    then something\n",
    "    else do nothing\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Types of ACLs\n",
    "    - Standard: uses source IP address in an IP packet as the condition test, decisions based on source IP\n",
    "        - Permits or denies an entire suite of protocols without distinguishing type of IP traffic\n",
    "    - Extended: Evaluates many fields in the layer 3 and 4 headers of an IP packet\n",
    "        - Source and destination IP addresses, protocol field of network layer header, port number, transport header\n",
    "    - Inbound: Packets processed by ACL before being routed to outbound interface\n",
    "        - Packets that are denied won't be routed and are discarded before routing is complete\n",
    "    - Outbound: Access controls applied to outbound packets on an interface are routed to outbound interface and processed by ACL before being queued\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "BASIC RULES\n",
    "1. Deny any addresses from your internal networks\n",
    "2. Deny any local host addresses 127.0.0.0/7\n",
    "3. Deny any reserved private addresses\n",
    "4. Deny any addresses in the IP multicast range (224.0.0.0/4)\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems**\n",
    "- Helps to detect attacks and intrusions on the system by looking for fingerprints of strange or malicious things going on in the network\n",
    "- Network IDS\n",
    "    - Seperate device attached to the network via a switch\n",
    "    - Can responsd passively or actively\n",
    "        - Activity is logged, notifications are sent as alerts\n",
    "        - Shunning - choose to ignore certain types of attacks (for attacks that won't affect your network)\n",
    "        - Can close a port being attacked (ex. port 21 (FTP) being attacked, can close for 60 seconds)\n",
    "            - Would be bad for any service that needs to be up 24/7\n",
    "        - Can create a honeypot\n",
    "            - Intended to deceive attacker long enough to gather identification information on the attacker\n",
    "    - Host based IDS\n",
    "        - Typically implemented on servers to run on a single system to detect abnormalities on that system alone by monitoring applications, system logs, and event logs\n",
    "        - [Snort is an open-source host-based IDS](https://www.snort.org/)\n",
    "        \n",
    "### Principles\n",
    "- Implicit deny\n",
    "    - If a user isn't mentioned in the .allow file they are implicitly denied\n",
    "    - Grant few people access rather than manage long lists\n",
    "- Least-priveledged mode\n",
    "    - Users get bare minimum of resources they need access to\n",
    "    - access level is always lowest possible\n",
    "- Separation\n",
    "    - Sepearate administrative duties to know which admin has access to what part of the network\n",
    "- Rotate\n",
    "    - Cross train people in various jobs\n",
    "    \n",
    "**Access Control Models**\n",
    "1. Mandatory Access Control (MAC)\n",
    "- Everyones role regarding the network and related information access is set in stone\n",
    "- users can't share information unless explicitly allowed\n",
    "- Strictest and least flexible, which gives admins the most control\n",
    "2. Discretionary Access Control (DAC)\n",
    "- Users have a say about who can access what data\n",
    "- Basically the opposite of a MAC and can result in a completely open system\n",
    "3. Role-Based Access Control\n",
    "- Access to resource is based on the *ROLE* of the individual within a company\n",
    "- Users get access based on who they are and what they do\n",
    "4. Rule-Based Access Control\n",
    "- Predefined security policies based on specific *RULES* are used to determine network access\n",
    "- Assumes users with the same roles may actually have different needs"
