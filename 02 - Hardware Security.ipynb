    "1. BIOS Boot Password\n",
    "    - Set up a password through the BIOS which requires login on every bootup\n",
    "    - This will prevent anyone from getting to the OS software by having to login at BIOS step\n",
    "    - If needing reset due to forgotten password:\n",
    "        - Will require a second computer with internet access\n",
    "            - After three failed logins, the option to send password to a secondary computer on the network will be available\n",
    "        - If no secondary computer present: Remove MB battery for ~15 minutes (will cause battery to lose all power)\n",
    "            - Reinsert battery and all MB settings will be reset including the password\n",

    "2. If using a data center with server cabinets\n",
    "    - Having physical access to servers/computers would allow someone to take advantage of the above vulnerability\n",
    "    - Make sure to lock cabinets using a lock requiring a key (preferably physical key)\n",
