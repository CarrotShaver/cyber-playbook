    "# Networks\n",
    "**Basic Types Of Networks by Size**\n",
    "- PAN: Personal Area Network\n",
    "    - The network that a single person uses\n",
    "- LAN: Local Area Network\n",
    "    - Network provided to a small area\n",
    "    - Usually considered this type if it has a router\n",
    "- CAN: Campus Area Network\n",
    "    - Usually the network of universities and schools\n",
    "- WAN: Wide Area Network\n",
    "    - Can span cities, states, countries\n",
    "    - Connects multiple smaller network types together\n",
    "    - Usually runs slower due to number of users and devices\n",
    "    - The internet is a WAN\n",
    "**Other Types of Networks**\n",
    "- MAN: Metropolitan Area Network\n",
    "    - Usually owned by a person or company to provide access to businesses or state\n",
    "- SAN: Storage Area Network\n",
    "    - High speed network of storage devices\n",
    "    - Usually things like servers, and is accessible by network servers\n",
    "    - Many virtual SANs are becoming popular now\n",
    "- WLAN: Wireless Local Area Network\n",
    "    - Small geographical wireless network\n",
    "    - Contains an access point and a client\n",
    "- VPN: Virtual Private Network\n",
    "    - Connects a WAN link to a remote LAN\n",
    "    - Uses a tunnel to connect like SSH\n",
    "- VLAN: Virtual Local Area Network\n",
    "    - All devices connected to a switch\n",
    "\n",
    "# Topologies\n",
    "- How a network is designed and laid out\n",
    "- All logistics involved with the hardware, connections, cables, and locations of a network\n",
    "- Multiple topologies can be used to represent a network, or there can be multiple topologies within a network\n",
    "**Some Types of Networks**\n",
    "- Bus network\n",
    "    - All devices connected on a cable\n",
    "- Star network\n",
    "    - Connections going to a single hub, branching out from that hub\n",
    "- Ring network\n",
    "    - All nodes are connected to create a closed loop\n",
    "    - Kind of limited, but good for speed\n",
    "    - If one is down, all go down\n",
    "    - Generates a token, which circulates through the entire network\n",
    "- Mesh network\n",
    "    - Every node connected to every other node in a network\n",
    "**Main Types of Networks**\n",
    "- Peer to Peer\n",
    "    - Two or more PCs connected together and sharing resources without going through a separate server\n",
    "    - Examples could be filesharing, many games use p2p to set up multiplayer, torrenting\n",
    "- Client Server\n",
    "    - Clients talk to each other by going through a server provider\n",
    "    - Servers provide some service to the clients which run pretty consistently\n",
    "\n",
    "# Cables and Connections\n",
    "**Types of cables**\n",
    "- Coaxial cables\n",
    "    - Used for things like connecting to a TV for cable\n",
    "- Copper cables\n",
    "    - CAT-5 cables used to create ethernet cables\n",
    "        - Two types: straight through and crossover \n",
    "            - Crossover for router-switch, switch-switch, etc. (but nowadays most can auto-detect)\n",
    "            - Straight-through for computers\n",
    "- Fiber cables\n",
    "    - Glass cables which fire light through a \"tunnel\"\n",
    "    - Very fast data transfer rates\n",
    "    - Hard to manufacture and somewhat fragile cables\n",
    "**Types of Connectors**\n",
    "- Switches: creates a network\n",
    "    - Uses MAC addresses\n",
    "- Routers: connects a network\n",
    "    - Uses IP addresses\n",
    "\n",
    "# OSI Model\n",
    "- Standardized model for connections created in 1970's to explain how a network should work on different layers\n",
    "    - Uses various protocols at different layers\n",
    "- Layers:\n",
    "    - 1 Physical\n",
    "        - Ethernet\n",
    "    - 2 Data Link\n",
    "        - Switch\n",
    "    - 3 Network\n",
    "        - Routers\n",
    "        - IP (internet)\n",
    "    - 4 Transport\n",
    "        - TCP (internet)\n",
    "    - 5 Session\n",
    "        - Very little focus(?)\n",
    "    - 6 Presentation\n",
    "    - 7 Applicaiton\n",
    "        - FTP, TFTP, HTTP, SMTP, DNS, TELNET, SNMP\n",
    "        - Layer at which most users interact\n",
    "    - Acronyms\n",
    "        - All People Seem To Need Data Processing\n",
    "        - People Don't Need Those Stupid Packets Anyway"
