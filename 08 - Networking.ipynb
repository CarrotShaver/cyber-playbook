    "# IPv4\n",
    "- Internet Protocol ver. 4\n",
    "- Routes most traffic on internet, connectionless protocol for packet switched networks\n",
    "- Qualified as best effort delivery - meaning it is not guaranteed delivery, but uses other protocols to help\n",
    "    - ex. uses TCP to help with delivery\n",
    "- Falls under the Network Layer (layer 3)\n",
    "- 32 bits (4 bytes) in an IP address 255.255.255.255, of which ~4 billion unique addresses are currently used\n",
    "- Network addresses is the address used by the network to send packets\n",
    "    - Every network from a device shares the host network base IP\n",
    "        - Usually the first 3 bytes are shared as the network address, and the last byte is divided among the network\n",
    "        - ex. 192.168.1.XXX where 192.168.1 is the network address, and the XXX can be distributed amongst devices on the network\n",
    "        \n",
    "**Broadcast address** \n",
    "- Is used by all applications and hosts to send information to all hosts on the network\n",
    "- Various types of broadcasts will identify both the type of network/device it wants to broadcast to, as well as the IP which should receive it\n",
    "1. **Unicast Broadcasting**\n",
    "    - One device communicating with another\n",
    "    - The most common way that devices communicate among networks\n",
    "2. **Anycast Routing** \n",
    "    - delivers a message to any one out of a group of nodes, typically the one nearest to the source\n",
    "3. **Multicast Routing** \n",
    "    - delivers a message to a group of nodes that have expressed interest in receiving the message\n",
    "4. **Geocast Routing** \n",
    "    - delivers a message to a geographic area\n",
    "5. **Broadcast Routing** \n",
    "    - delivers a message to all nodes in the network\n",
    "\n",
    "**Classes of Networks**\n",
    "- Each class is differentiated by the opening reserved bits \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Class A\n",
    "    - Network portion is first byte, and 3 bytes of hosts (N.H.H.H)\n",
    "    - First bit of network portion is reserved, next 7 are distributed\n",
    "    - Class A network's first bit should be '0'XXXXXXX\n",
    "    - 10.X.X.X Used for private networks\n",
    "    - Common Class A networks start with 10.X.X.X\n",
    "        - 10.0.0.0 would be the network address\n",
    "        - 10.255.255.255 would be the broadcast address\n",
    "2. Class B\n",
    "    - \"In between A and C\"... wew lad\n",
    "    - Network portion is first two bytes, and following two bytes are Hosts (N.N.H.H)\n",
    "    - Class B networks reserve the first two bits to be '10'XXXXXX (first byte >=128 and <=191)\n",
    "    - 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255 used for private networks\n",
    "3. Class C\n",
    "    - Network portion is first three bytes, and following byte is for Hosts (N.N.N.H)\n",
    "    - Class C networks start with '110'XXXXX (always >=192)\n",
    "    - 192.168.X.X Used for private networks\n",
    "    - The reserved bit protocol helps a broadcast to quickly determine what type of network it is being sent to\n",
    "\n",
    "### Subnet Masks\n",
    "- Used to help show what bytes are network and what bytes are host\n",
    "**Classes of Subnets**\n",
    "1. Class A: 255.0.0.0/8 shows that the first 8 bits are reserved for a network\n",
    "2. Class B: 55.255.0.0/16 shows that the first 16 bits are reserved for a network\n",
    "3. Class C: 255.255.255.0/24 shows that the first 24 bits are reserved for a network\n",
    "    - Using an AND operation with an IP and a Subnet will show you the Network Address of an IP\n",
    "        - This is the network that an IP address is on\n",
    "**Calculating Subnets**\n",
    "- Number of possible subnets increases by orders of 2, which will decrease hosts per network by orders of 2\n",
    "    - For example 255.255.255.128/25 would be a subnet with 2 subnets and 128 hosts per subnet\n",
    "        - 255.255.255.192/26 would be a subnet with 4 subnets and 64 hosts per subnet\n",
    "        - 255.255.255.228/27 would be a subnet with 8 subnets and 32 hosts per subnet\n",
    "        - etc.\n",
    "    - Would need to subtract 2 from every number of hosts to reserve 1 IP for the subnet and 1 IP for the broadcast IP\n",
    "**Static vs Dynamic IP addresses**\n",
    "- Static is an assigned address on a network which does not change\n",
    "- Dynamic addressing uses DHCP to distribute addresses amongst the network\n",
    "    - Commonly used in public wifi locations to assign IPs to devices accessing a network\n",
    "    - Basically used whenever the number of devices on a network might be dynamically changing\n",
