    "# Users and Groups\n",
    "- **Users** are naive children, who cannot be trusted, which is why they are controlled in **Groups**\n",
    "- Users can belong to multiple groups, which at a basic level reject or accept user actions\n",
    "- All processes on a system are attached to a user, or can be accessed by certain users/groups\n",
    "- Principle of Least Privelage (Good security policy)\n",
    "    - Basically the principle of giving users as little privelages as possible\n",
    "    - User should have a good reason to be given access to something\n",
    "\n",
    "### Users\n",
    "- Authorizing and Autheticating\n",
    "    - Different meanings.  Authentication is verifying a user is legitimate (ex. username+password).\n",
    "        - Usually there should be several layers of authentication due to vulnerabilities\n",
    "    - Authorization involves permissions for a user, the programs and utilities available to a user\n",
    "    \n",
    "    #### Authorization\n",
    "    - Setting up a secure password\n",
    "        - Password length. Longer is better to avoid brute force methods.  Passphrases are effective.\n",
    "        - Secure characters (e.g. minimum number of special characters/symbols)\n",
    "        - Password manager (ex. lastpass), reasoning being using a company who's job is to secure your password vs. yourself\n",
    "        - Resetting passwords, recycling passwords.  Minimum length of time and maximum length of time.\n",
    "            - Subjective as far as time goes, but generally don't want users to have to reset password constantly/never\n",
    "            - Passwords should require a cooldwon to be recycled, or should never be recyclable\n",
    "\n",
    "### Characteristics of Groups\n",
    "- Role\n",
    "    - Everything within the system has a role, which different users can access\n",
    "    - AWS (Amazon Web Services) very role based\n",
    "- Organizational\n",
    "    - Different levels of authorization for different sections of an organization\n",
    "- User\n",
    "    - Smaller servers can be specialized for each user on the system\n",
    "- Resource\n",
    "    - Grouping based on giving out resources\n",
    "    \n",
    "# Windows\n",
    "- Types of users:\n",
    "    1. Administrators\n",
    "        - \"God mode\", admin accounts have access to everything and can do anything\n",
    "        - Default for first account created (aka root)\n",
    "    2. Power Users\n",
    "        - Most permissions available (almost admin level), but cannot install new devices or access other users' files or folders without explicit permissions set.  Can edit registry and system files.\n",
    "    3. Users\n",
    "        - Cannot edit registry or access system files or other user account files without explicit permissions set.\n",
    "        - Can create groups but can only manage the groups they create.\n",
    "        - Known as \"standard users\"\n",
    "    4. Guests\n",
    "        - Allows access to a guest account login\n",
    "        - Best practice is to disable access since most systems don't allow guests\n",
    "- Managing Users\n",
    "    ### Computer Management Tool\n",
    "    - Search -> **Computer Management** -> Local Users and Groups\n",
    "        - Can see the users and groups folders and the accounts that have been created\n",
    "        - In windows 10, may need to activate this service with the run.exe->lusrmgr.msc\n",
    "            - Unavailable in windows 10 home edition\n",
    "        #### Creating users and groups in Computer Management\n",
    "        - Right click on a folder to create a new user/group\n",
    "        - To add a user to a group, go to the group and select users\n",
    "            - Can choose to filter among various categories\n",
    "            - Add various users to a group and apply\n",
    "            - When creating a group or user, should try to make the comment descriptive\n",
    "    - Permissions for varoius files and folders can be set in the **Properties** tab\n",
    "        - Navigate to security tab to grant permissions to various Groups or Users\n",
    "        - Going to the **Advanced...** tab allows for special permissions for users and groups\n",
    "            - **Inheritance**\n",
    "                - Can break the inheritance of permissions from object's parent, uncheck inheritable permissions\n",
    "                - Generally bad practice to disable inheritance, better to use \"deny\"\n",
    "    ### CLI User and Group Management\n",
    "    - use 'net /?' command\n",
    "        - Can search for specific groups with **'net localgroup XXXX'**\n",
    "        - Create a new group with **'net localgroup _GROUPNAME_ /add /comment:\"These people access XXX part of system\"'**\n",
    "        - Create a new user with **'net _USERNAME_ _PASSWORD_ /add'**\n",
    "            - Add the user to a group with **'net group _GROUPNAME_ _USERNAME_ /add'**\n",
    "    ### User Account Control Settings\n",
    "    - Can be found in the search function\n",
    "        - Changes when and how users are notified when changes are being made to a computer\n",
    "        - Important because most desktops and users only have one account as an admin which allows root access\n",
    "            - Makes windows more easily targetable by malware\n",
    "            - Should not disable alerts as it can clue you or the user in to unauthorized processes\n",
    "    ### Local Security Policy\n",
    "    - Account Policies\n",
    "        - Password Policy\n",
    "            - This is where you can set the password settings for users\n",
    "            - Things like password histories, age, length, etc.\n",
    "                - Passwords should not allow for reversible encryption\n",
    "        - Account Lockout Policy\n",
    "            - Flags an account after a certain number of failed logins\n",
    "            - Helps to prevent brute-force methods\n",
    "    - Local Policies\n",

    "            - Rename the administrator account to help stop malicious scripts\n",
    "            - Can notify user to change password x days in advance\n",
    "            - Disable ability to shutdown from login screen\n",
    "- NTFS File System\n",
    "    - File sharing system built around user/group permissions for windows\n",
    "    - Folder permissions: Full control, modify, read & execute, list folder contents, read, write\n",
    "    - File permissions: full control, modify, read & execute, read, write\n",
    "- Encrypting a password with keybase\n",
    "    - Make a keybase account\n",
    "    - Use the **keybase encrypt -m \"_PASSWORD_\" _username_**\n",
    "        - Save the encrypted message in a text file and maybe title the file indicating use\n",
    "        - Retrieve and decrypt an encrypted message with keybase decrypt -i _FILENAME_\n",
    "### Using icacls to change permissions\n",
    "- Permissions\n",
    "    - CLI permission management with **icacls** command\n",
    "        - Grant\n",
    "            - Equivalent to \"Add\" in the permissions gui\n",
    "            - Using this command will add any permissions specified unless using the ':r' flag which replaces permissions\n",
    "                - Example would be icacls test.txt /grant:r user115:(R)\n",
    "                    - Would overwrite all permissions to user115 for file test.txt to be READ only\n",
    "            - **icacls _FILENAME_ /grant _USERNAME_:(_PERMISSIONFLAGS_)**\n",
    "                - Some permission flag examples that could be used here would be (RX) which would give read and execute\n",
    "        - Deny\n",
    "            - Will remove permissions from a user\n",
    "        - icacls _FILENAME_\n",
    "            - checks all users' permissions for the file\n",
    "        - Can use the Everyone username to do grants/denys to all users\n",
    "\n",
    "#Linux\n",
    "- Use the **/** command to find root folder (ex. ls /)\n",
    "- Can use **ls /home** to find users on a system\n",
    "- Use the **man _command_** to read the manual page for commands\n",
    "### Changing permissions with CLI\n",
    "- Permissions\n",
    "    - Can check permissions on files and folders with ls -l command\n",
    "        - example output: (drwxrwxr-x 4 user123 group1 4096 Jan 1 12:59 Documents)\n",
    "            - Format for above example shows permissions, number of files in the directory, the user, group, permission code, date accessed, folder name\n",
    "            - For the drwxrwxrwx format the first character signifies 'd' for directory or '-' for a file\n",
    "            - The following three sets of 'rwx' (read, write, execute) each control for a user, group, and everyone else, in that order\n",
    "    - Change permissions with the chmod command\n",
    "        - Can change permissions for all files and folders contained in a folder with **chmod -R _PERMISSIONCODE_**\n",
    "        - Permission code is based on the rwx/rwx/rwx in a 4+2+1/4+2+1/4+2+1 format\n",
    "            - If you want a file to be rwx/rw/r it would be **chmod 764 _FILE/FOLDERNAME_**\n",
    "### Users and Groups\n",
    "- Groups\n",
    "    - the **groups _USERNAME_** command will show all the groups a user is a part of\n",

    "    ### Deleting or Adding a Group\n",
    "    - Use the **groupadd** or **groupdel** commands\n",
    "- Users\n",
    "    ### Adding a User\n",
    "    - Several options to add a user\n",
    "        - use the **adduser _USERNAME_** command (must be root or use sudo command)\n",
    "        - on a linux server will need to add the --force-badname flag (probably)\n",
    "        - to allow a user to create their own password use the **chage** command\n",
    "            - ex. (**chage -d 0 _username_**), and from there can specify the password requires a change\n",
    "        - the **useradd _username*_** command will just add a user with no real settings, so shouldn't really use this\n",
    "            - users added this way won't have a home folder in most versions of linux\n",
    "    ### Finding Users\n",
    "    - Use the **cat /etc/passwd** command to find a full list of users\n",
    "        - Can use this command to find user IDs\n",
    "        - users with the /bin/bash ending cannot be logged into\n",
    "        - **cat /etc/group** command shows all groups users are a part of"
