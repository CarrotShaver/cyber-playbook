    "6. Draw network diagrams\n",
    "7. Prepare proxies\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Scan Types**\n",
    "- TCP connect() Scan `-sT`\n",
    "    - Easy to detect\n",
    "    - Checks for the syn,ack response\n",
    "    - Name from the connect socket system to create a connection\n",
    "    - Ports reported as \"open\" can definitely be connected to\n",
    "    - An IDS will usually log connection requests to ports not open\n",
    "- SYN Stealth Scan `-sS` (needs privelages)\n",
    "    - Half-open scan, connection never fully established\n",
    "    - Developed with above limitation intended\n",
    "    - SYN Stealth scan is more stealthy, but still detectable\n",
    "    - Leverages 3-way handshake protocol specifics\n",
    "- Other Scans: `-sF, -sN, -sX`\n",
    "    1. FIN Scan `-sF` - Send packets wiht FIN flag\n",
    "    2. Null Scan `-sN` - Send packets with no flag set\n",
    "    3. Xmas Tree Scan `-sX` - Send packets with FIN, PUSH, and URG flags set\n",
    "- Ping Scan `-sP, -P0` (recommended not to use because it's notorious for being detected and blocked)\n",
    "    - Ping scan used to see which hosts are online and responding to requests\n",
    "    - Sends an ICMP echo request first andd if no ICMP echo response i received, it will try a TCP ping which sends a SYN or ACK to any port to determine if it gets a response back.\n",
    "    - Use the -P0 flag to disable the ICMP echo request and only try a TCP ping\n",
    "- Version Detection Scan `-sV`\n",
    "    - Scans services running and tries to find information about those services\n",
    "    - 'V' flag can be added to any scan\n",
    "- Agressive Scan `-sA`\n",
    "    - Does a traceroute, os detection, and service detection\n",
    "- List Scan `-sL` (passive scan, so totally legal)\n",
    "    - Does a reverse DNS lookup to view all other DNS names running on the same subnet\n",
    "- UDP Scan `-sU`\n",
    "    - UDP scan will check for UDP specific services like DNS and DHCP\n",
    "- Idle Scan `-sI` (stealthiest of scans)\n",
    "    - Makes use of a zombie host to never show origin host and can be used for MitM attacks\n",
    "    - Useful for determining the relationship between two machines\n",
    "**Useful Flags**\n",
    "- Use all types `-A`\n",
    "    - This flag will do a very aggressive flag with a full scan\n",
    "- Scan all ports `-p-`\n",
    "    - Scan all 65535 ports\n",
    "- TCP Ping scan `-PN`\n",
    "    - Pings hosts which are likely blocking ICMP with TCP instead\n",
    "- ACK Ping scan `-PA`\n",
    "    - Pings with both ICMP and TCP (in case ICMP is blocked)\n",
    "- Decoy scan `-D`\n",
    "    - Specify to use random IP's `sudo nmap -sV -v 10.0.1.69 -D RND:25`\n",
    "    - Specify a range of IP's `-D 10.0.1.1, 10.0.1.254`\n",
    "- Fragmentation `-f`\n",
    "    - Use with main TCP scan types `-sS, -sF, -sN, -sX` to fragment packets making it harder for a firewall to determine the contents of the packet\n",
    "- Source port spoof `--source-port`\n",
    "    - Spoof the source port to take advantage of firewall rules\n",
    "- MAC address spoof `--spoof-mac`\n",
    "    - Spoof the source MAC to take advantage of firewall rules\n",
    "**Scan Timings**\n",
    "- Slow scan to reduce detection `-T`\n",
    "    - Use timing `-T 0` (paranoid) or `-T 1` (sneaky) to be avoid detection\n",
    "        - Paranoid is 5 minutes between packets sent and sneaky is 15 seconds\n",
    "- Specify timing between probes `--scan-delay`\n",
    "- Run with threading `-min-parallelism, -max-parallelism`\n",
    "    - Ex. specifiy a certain number of threads to spawn `nmap -sV 10.0.1.21 -max-parallelism 20`\n",
    "- Fast scan `-F`\n",
    "    - Add this flag to substantially increase scan times, and decrease stealth\n",
    "    \n",
    "**Scripts**\n",
    "- see https://nmap.org/nsedoc/ for scripts and categories for nmap\n",
    "- Kali has most scripts pre-installed, check /usr/share/nmap/scripts\n",
    "- To use a script `nmap --script scriptname target`"
